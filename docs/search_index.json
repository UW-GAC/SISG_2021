The official SISG web page can be found here (requires login) – course evaluations and certificates of completion are available via this page. Lectures Slides for lectures are linked below in the schedule. All lectures will be given via Zoom, and recordings of lectures will be posted afterwards. Zoom Link for lectures: https://washington.zoom.us/j/92319788832 Tutorials and Exercises To work through the tutorials and exercises, log into NHLBI BioData Catalyst powered by Seven Bridges with your username and password – we will use this platform for all live demonstrations during the course. All of the R code and data can also be downloaded from the github repository from which the site is built and run on your local machine after the course has ended.
